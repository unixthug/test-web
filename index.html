    <h1>Dear Zoe:</h1>
    <br>
    <p id="note">
      When I first met you, I knew I wanted to get to know you better.<br>
      I was still getting used to talking to people again after being<br>
      in quarantine.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      But you caught my eye and I wanted to push past my awkwardness and try talking to you.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I thought you were really cute and I was tired of missing out<br>
      on connections with people just because<br>I was worried I would be too awkward.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      When I got your contact and played games with you it made me happy
      to make my first friend after quarantine.
    </p>   
    <hr>
    <p>
      Eventually I started to catch feelings though, and on my own<br>
      I decided to cut communication with you out of respect for<br>
      your relationship.
    </p>     
    <br>
    <p>
      Later I told you that and we talked a little bit more but over time it<br>became very on and off as we went our separate ways.
    </p>   
    <hr>
    <p>
      By the time I was done with my fall semester I was fully over my previous
      feelings for you and had a whole lot of new friends.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      You had sent me a couple messages over time on Instagram and I had wished
      you a happy birthday in early December.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      But coming into the new year, I started thinking about you and<br>
      wanted to try to become better friends.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      As I talked to you again, I was once again blasted by<br>
      your aura and wanted to see you in person.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      After hanging out with you a single time I knew<br>one thing for certain:<br>
      I wanted to see your smile and hear your laughs and giggles<br>
      much more.
    </p>   
    <hr>
    <p>
      I asked you to be my valentine 1 year ago and from there we<br>
      continued to grow a beautiful relationship together.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      You make me so happy Zoe I will never be able to put into words<br>
      How much of an effect you have had on my life.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      For years I had been mentally messed up over<br>anything romantically
      involved.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      My first experience with love I cut short and it broke me.<br>
      And the next experiences pulverized the shards I had made.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      After being with you and trying my best to make you happy<br>
      I've learned a lot about patience, and I've tried<br>
      to make you as happy as I could despite any<br>
      ongoing problems or issues I might have going on.
    </p>   
    <hr>
    <p>
      Hopefully I make you even half as happy as you make me.<br>
      I will do my best to make sure that we spend the next Valentines<br>
      and many more after that together.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      I love you so much Zoe, my light, my love, my everything.<br>
      I have a surprise for you!
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      I will be home on Valentine's Day for my little lady!!
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      Because of school it is hard for me to see you<br>
      every single holiday or milestone.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>
      Luckily, I get to see your little face this one :)
    </p>
